Corp Por, the team behind CODEX, consists of two individuals known by their alias Miphon and Smoozilla. Both have worked with Citadel Studios developing the Shards Engine for nearly 10 years. With their experience in the genre, their expertise of the engine that powered it and a love for MMO development, CODEX was created. In November 2022, Corp Por acquired the CODEX property from Citadel Studios and a license to use the Shards Engine in perpetuity.
